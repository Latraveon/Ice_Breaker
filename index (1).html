    <!-- Paragraph summarizing why glaciers are melting -->
    <p>
        Glaciers and sea ice are melting due to rising global temperatures caused by human-induced climate change. 
        Increased greenhouse gas emissions trap heat in the atmosphere, disrupting the natural balance and causing polar regions 
        to warm at an accelerated rate. The melting ice contributes to rising sea levels and affects ecosystems worldwide.
